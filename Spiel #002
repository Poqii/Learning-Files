A binary operation in python is, in simple terms, a way to make a value out of two values.

Augmented assignment operators take these and combines them with an assignment operator(=).
e.g. instead of:
x=10
x=x+5
print(x) #15
you do:
x+=5
print(x) #15

The walrus operator is a bit special, it ain't a type of augmented assignment operator. It allows you to use assignment inside of an expression, for example:
if (m := len(word))>0:

rather than:

m= len(word)
if m>0:

You only nee the first parantheses to specify what to assign to m in this case.

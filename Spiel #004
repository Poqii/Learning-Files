Lambdas are keywords that create function objects anonymously.
They work in this form:

lambda arguments:expression

e.g. a= lambda x:x-3
print(a(3)) #0 

An iterable is something that can be iterated over, this is just a way of saying running each item over.

The map() function applies one function to an iterable.

e.g. a=[1,2,3]
print(list(map(lambda x:x-1, a)) #[0,1,2]

An iterable in python is something you can loop over; while an iterator is the thing that iterates over an iterable that also tracks what position of the iterable it is at.
This means an iterator is made up of two main parts.
If you want to iterate over an iterable (like a list), you can use the function iter()
e.g. a=iter([1,2,3,4])

For this example, if you call next(a) four times, it will appear as:
1
2
3
4

If you call it another time after that, you'll get:
StopIteration.

This is because iter() created an iterator object and assigned it to a, while next() is a function.

Enumerate() is basically a more complex version of an iterator, where now we also track the index of the value with the value itself.

e.g. a = [1,2,3,4] 
b = enumerate(a)
print(next(b))
print(next(b))

#(0,1) (1,2)

zip() takes two iterables and produces tuples by matching'em up.

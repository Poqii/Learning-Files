To check if a data type is the one you want, you use isintance(). This is a function which requires you to list a specified data type following your object that you want to check against. 
E.g. isinstance('Hello, World!', bool) #False

isinstance() can be used in several useful ways; you can check for invalid inputs and to use different ways of handling responses via if statements. 
Like in, 
x=input("Name something.")
if isinstance(x, str):
    print("That's a string.")
else:
    print("That ain't a string.")

The difference between "=, == and is" is a few things.

= is just for assignment, it doesn't mean equal in the math sense. 

== checks if two objects have equivalent value, while is checks if two objects point to the exact same thing in memory.

What does this mean? Well, imagine two streets called Major and Minor--on these streets, the first house looks exactly the same in every way possible. Same people, same alabaster walls etc. 

These two houses are the same; equal. So if == would come up true if I applied it to these two houses.

But is wouldn't. This is because althought everything's the same, the address isn't. The houses are on different streets.

That's the difference between is and ==.

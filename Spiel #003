Lists are organized arrangements of objects that are zero indexed and mutable, meaning the first item is at the index zero, and you can change the items in a list.
Lists use square brackets.

This example list will be used throughout this file: a_list= ["one", "two", "three", ['four','five']]

To change an item, I can just do a_list[index] and replace it with a new value.
e.g. a_list[0]="Five"
print(a_list) # ["Five", "two", "three", ['four','five']]

To remove an item from a list, use the del statement
For example: del a_list[1:3]
print(a_list) #one

When printing lists, to get rid of the square brackets, unpack the list using the splat operator *.
e.g. print(*a_list) #one two three four

You can also access an item of a list within a list. 
print(a_list[3][1]) #five

Unrelated note, you can tell Python how to unpack something using the * operator.

Unpacking for iterables is taking them apart and assigning each of the items into new targets or passing each item as an argument.

For example:

a, *b = a_list # a is now assigned to one, while b is assigned to all the rest.

This happens because the * doesn't tell python to unpack the thing it's next to like earlier, but rather tells it how to split the items.

A final thing is just a way to cull what ya get.

a_list[1::2] #[two,['four','five']

Interestingly that last little number is added onto the start number, not just every increment of 2 starting from the position of 0.
